Responsive E-Commerce Website build using Next.js, React.js, TypeScript and many other technologies. Users can sign in with Google, search and order products. The app also features a great search experience powered by Atlas Search, part of MongoDB Atlas, including autocomplete search box, full-text search with fuzzy matching.

In this project I learned alot about MongoDB, Mongoose, Next.js, NextAuth and Tailwind CSS.

## Features of the project

- Add to Cart Functionality!

- Cart page where you can add/remove products!

- Complete Stripe Payments Checkout Flow for all the orders in your basket!

- MongoDB database, including dataset of about 20,000 products to use and explore!

- Custom Express.js REST API

- Tailwind CSS and Heroicons to build a responsive website!

- The app also features a great search experience powering Atlas Search, part of MongoDB Atlas, including autocomplete search box, full-text search with fuzzy matching.
